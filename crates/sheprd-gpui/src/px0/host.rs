//! px0 on the SSH hosts the windows connect to, one workbench per host, so a
//! remote workspace's px0 tab opens the workspace's own folder there. The
//! workbench on this computer cannot: the folder is on another machine.
//!
//! Each host's workbench is a [`worker::Worker`] whose `ssh` runs `serve.sh`
//! on the host. The script starts px0 there, as the app does here, with a
//! registry of the app's own under `~/.herdr-gpui/px0-state`, and reports the
//! loopback port it listens on; the worker forwards that port here. As here,
//! the app never installs px0 on a host. A workbench runs until the app quits
//! or its tab's Retry starts it again; nothing restarts on its own.
//!
//! px0 serves its workbench without a token, so on the host, as on this
//! computer, anyone who can reach its loopback port can use it.
